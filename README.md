This is the project portfolio of me, David Goodwin.

The earliest works, listed at the bottom, came from school projects when I attended [Code Fellows](http://codefellows.org) in Portland, which has since spun off into its own entity, [Alchemy Code Lab](http://www.alchemycodelab.com/).  Newer projects are personal and freelance works.
